# Hi there, I'm Seungtack Lee ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on C++ programming.
Feel free to explore my repositories, and please leave a star when you are cloning!

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:
- Advanced C++ features (e.g., modern C++, templates, function pointers)
- Algorithm design and optimization

## ðŸ’» Skills:
- Programming Languages: C++
- Tools: Git, Visual Studio, etc.

  
## ðŸŒŸ Projects:
- **Custom Vector Class**: A custom implementation of a dynamic array class, similar to `std::vector`. It includes basic functionalities like `push_back`, `resize`, and full STL-style iterator support (iterator, const_iterator, reverse_iterator, const_reverse_iterator).
- **Custom List Class**: A custom implementation of a doubly linked list, similar to `std::list`. It includes basic functionalities like `push_back`, `insert`, and full STL-style iterator support (iterator, const_iterator, reverse_iterator, const_reverse_iterator).

(More will be added.)

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to open an issue or contribute!
